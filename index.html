                            <p>A doorway into the lives of women whose stories embody courage, compassion, and endurance. In the face of conflict, disaster, and hardship, they rose as leaders, storytellers, and guardians of peace.</p>
                            <p>UN Women presents this collection to honor their experiences and to inspire us all to recognize that peace is not an ideal we hope for, but a journey we must walk together.</p>

                        <p>Across generations, storytelling has been a cornerstone of culture and wisdom, a way to pass down knowledge, preserve identity, and ignite change. In Central Sulawesi, a land rich in tradition and resilience, women have long held the role of storytellers. Women are the guardians of history, peacebuilders in their communities, and voices of strength in times of crisis.</p>

                        <p>Today, their stories carry not only the weight of tradition, but also the momentum of a global movement, one that recognizes women's voices as vital - not only in honoring the strength and wisdom the past, but in shaping a more peaceful and just future.</p>

                        <p>This global movement is guided by the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda - an international framework born from the landmark UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in 2000 and further strengthened by a series of follow-up resolutions. The WPS agenda recognizes the distinct and often disproportionate impacts of conflict on women and girls, while affirming that they are not only survivors of crisis, but powerful agents of change capable of transforming the very conditions that give rise to violence and paving the way toward a more inclusive and enduring peace.</p>

                        <p>Turning global commitments into local action requires dedicated partnerships, sustained advocacy, and community leadership. As the lead UN agency on advancing the WPS agenda, UN Women supports women’s meaningful participation in conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and security efforts. In Indonesia, this commitment is reflected in the National Action Plan for the Protection and Empowerment of Women and Children during Social Conflicts (NAP WPS) and the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism that Leads to Terrorism (NAP PCVE), both of which integrate gender-responsive strategies to sustain peace and resilience.</p>

                        <p>While commitments and policy frameworks lay the foundation for peace and inclusion, it is through individual stories that the true meaning of these agendas comes to life. The WPS agenda is not only written in resolutions and plans; it is lived by women in their homes, communities, and everyday acts of courage and leadership. It is with this belief that this storybook was created: to honor the voices of women who are shaping the future from the ground up.</p>

                        <p>This book brings to life the lived experiences of eight remarkable women from Central Sulawesi, each embodying the spirit of peace and resilience. Their stories are woven into the fabric of the WPS agenda and are organized around its four pillars that are the guiding principles that frame both the challenges women face in conflict and the roles they play in building peace.</p>
